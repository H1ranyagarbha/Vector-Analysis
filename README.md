# Vector-Analysis
Vector Analysis with Python using NumPy!
Make sure you have Numpy installed on your system. 

To understand Vectors, I'd recommend a light reading of any High School Physics reader such as Halliday Resnick Krane or Halliday Resnick and Walker. It's of utmost importance to master Vector Analysis as a physics student if you want to actually get a grip on Physics. Vectors is Physics and Physics is Vectors. Vectors provides the basis for all of Mechanics and much more.
